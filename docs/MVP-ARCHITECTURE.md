# MVP Architecture Suggestions

This document reflects the current architecture of **thy-squeal**, reaching beyond the initial MVP goals into a highly modular and robust SQL server.

---

## Current Architecture (Summary)

```
Client (CLI/REPL)  →  POST /_query  →  Executor::execute(sql)
                                              ↓
                              Pest-based SQL Parser (sql/parser/)
                                              ↓
                              SQL Executor (sql/executor/)
                                              ↓
                              Storage Engine (storage/)
```

## Architectural Pillars

### 1. Modular SQL Engine
**Outcome**: Clean separation of parsing, evaluation, and execution.
- **Parser**: Split into statement-specific modules (`ddl`, `dml`, `select`) and expression parsing (`expr/`).
- **Evaluator**: Dedicated modules for column resolution, condition filtering, and expression evaluation.
- **Executor**: Highly decomposed into command-specific handlers, including specialized logic for aggregation, joins, and search.
- **Prepared Statements**: Efficient server-side query caching within the `Executor` via AST storage.

---

### 2. Robust Storage & Indexing
**Outcome**: High-performance in-memory storage with durable persistence.
- **Indexes**: Supports B-Tree and Hash indexes, including advanced features like JSON path, functional, and partial indexing.
- **Durability**: Synchronous Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) ensures data integrity across restarts.
- **Information Schema**: System metadata exposed via standard SQL queries.

---

### 3. ACID Transactions
**Outcome**: Atomicity and Isolation for complex operations.
- Uses `DatabaseState` snapshotting for transactional isolation.
- WAL logging for atomic `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` support.
